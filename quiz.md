1. What does HTTP stand for?
Hypertext Transfer Protcol

2. How would you describe what a protocol is to a complete newbie?
An agreed upon standard

3. Which part of this URL describes the protocol?: 
https://apis.scrimba.com/jsonplaceholder/posts
https

4. If you had to guess, which request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) would you
think we made in the previous challenge when we asked for data from the 
JSON Placeholder API?
GET

1. What's the difference between a Base URL and an Endpoint?
Base URL is the static portion of the total URL (and the API).

Given the following URLs from an example API:
* https://blahblahblah.com/api/v2/users
* https://blahblahblah.com/api/v2/products
* https://blahblahblah.com/api/v2/products/123

2. Which part is the Base URL?
https://blahblahblah.com/api/v2

3. What are the available endpoints?
users, products, products/123


Try to think of a time you used each of the four main methods
(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) in the real world as you went about
your regular usage of the internet. E.g. today, I checked the
weather on my phone which probably sent a GET request to retrieve
weather information.

GET: any web page

POST: adding an item to a todo list.

PUT: editing a blog post

DELETE: deleting a blog post.
